<h1>Chopstix Software Licence Terms</h1>

and you. Please read them carefully. They apply to the 
software and licence certificate you are being provided 
which includes the media on which you received it, if 
any. The terms also apply to any updates, supplements, 
internet-based services and support services for this 
software, unless other terms accompany those items. If 
so, those terms apply.</p>

<p><b>BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU 
  DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.</b></p>

<p>If you comply with these licence terms, you have the rights below.</p>

<li>make unlimited copies of the licence certificate for
  archival purposes; and</li>

<li>after written notice to Manorsoft and subject to

  the software on a permanent basis to another person 
  or entity, provided that you retain no copies of the 
  software and the transferee agrees to the terms of 
  this agreement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scope of Licence</h3>

<p>The software is licenced, not sold. This agreement only 
gives you some rights to use the software. Manorsoft 
reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives 
you more rights despite this limitation, you may use 
the software only as expressly permitted in this 
agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any 
technical limitations in the software that only allow 
you to use it in certain ways. You may not</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

internal network may copy and use the documentation for 
your internal, reference purposes.</p>

<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>

<p>This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, 
Internet-based services and support services that you 
use, are the entire agreement for the software and 
support services.</p>

<h3>Applicable Law</h3>

<p>Canada. If you acquired the software in Canada, Ontario 
law governs the interpretation of this agreement and 
applies to claims fro breach of it, regardless of 
conflict of laws principles. The laws of the province 
where you live govern all other claims, including 
claims under provincial consumer protection laws, 
unfair competition laws, and in tort.</p>

<p>Outside of Canada. If you acquired the software in any 
other country, the laws of that country apply.</p>

<h3>Legal Effect</h3>

<p>This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may 
have other rights under the laws of your country. You 
may also have rights with respect to the party from 
whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not 
change your rights under the laws of your country if 
the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>

<p>The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of 
using it. Manorsoft gives no express warranties, 
guarantees or conditions. You may have additional 
consumer rights under your local laws which this 
agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under 
your local laws, Manorsoft excludes the implied 
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular 
purpose and non-infringement.</p>

<h3>Limitation on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages</h3>

<p>You can recover from Manorsoft and its suppliers only 
direct damages up to CDN $5.00. You cannot recover any 
other damages, including consequential, lost profits, 
special, indirect or incidental damages.</p>

<p>This limitation applies to</p>

<ul>
<li>anything related to the software, services, content 
  (including code) on third party Internet sites, or 
  third party programs; and</li>

<li>claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, 
  guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, 
  or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable 
  law.</li>
</ul>

<p>It also applies even if Manorsoft knew or should have 
known about the possibility of the damages. The above 
limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because 
your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation 
of incidental, consequential or other damages.</p>
